This report evaluates the possibilities and potential of the Single-ISA
Heterogeneous Many-Core Computer (SHMAC) when it comes to accelerating
SHA256 hashing, the most important part of the process of mining bitcoins.

A SHA256 accelerator and a DMA is developed and integrated into a tile for
SHMAC and a system with multiple cores is tested in order to find out how
performance scales and what kind of performance and energy efficiency one
can expect from such a system.

The results show that using an accelerator provides about 3,5 times better
performance than calculating the hashes in software. They also show that
using a DMA further increases performance, although the performance does
not reach the neccessary number of hashes per second to be fast enough to
be used for mining bitcoins. The testing also reveals some limitations of
SHMAC's memory system.
