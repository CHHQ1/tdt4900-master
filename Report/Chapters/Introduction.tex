\chapter{Introduction}

In recent years, digital currencies know as ``cryptocurrencies'' have become popular
and most popular of these is Bitcoin. The term ``cryptocurrency'' stems from the fact
that a cryptographic hash function is at the core of the algorithms involved. For bitcoin,
the SHA-256 hash algorithm is used, although other currencies uses other algorithms. This
is more closely described in section \ref{sec:bitcoin}.

%Using bitcoin mining as an application, this project develops a SHA256 accelerator
%for the Single-ISA Heterogeneous Many-core Computer, SHMAC. To achieve higher throughputs
%and energy efficiency, a DMA is also developed. The two modules are integrated into
%a general-purpose CPU tile, and an estimation of the bitcoin mining efficiency is made.

\section{Original Assignment Text}

This project aims to develop a bitcoin mining accelerator that will ultimately be
used in the single-ISA, many-core, heterogeneous computing platform SHMAC. Bitcoin
mining is, at its core, a SHA256 hashing problem, so part of the assignment will
be to keep the interface generic enough such that other cryptographic algorithms
can be readily developed.

This part of the project will focus on building an end-to-end and fully functional
hardware and software system that is able to fully participate as a miner in the
network (that is, mine Bitcoins and communicate with peers).

The energy efficiency of the hardware implementation should be evaluated against that
of a general-purpose CPU and should constitute a major aspect of the report.

\section{Comments on the Assignment Text}

Recent hardware developments within the field of bitcoin mining, most important of
which is the introduction of dedicated ASIC mining chips, have led to bitcoin mining
using CPUs and GPUs being considered unprofitable and wasteful in terms of the energy
expended.

The assignment then boils down to: is bitcoin mining possible using SHMAC? Does the
mining process benefit from heterogenity and what performance gains are possible
using a dedicated SHA256 accelerator and a DMA?

Other relevant issues are how the system scales; given enough processing cores,
could SHMAC compare to dedicated bitcoin mining systems in power efficiency or
computing power?
