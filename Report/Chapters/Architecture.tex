\chapter{Architecture}
\label{cha:architecture}

In order to develop a bitcoin mining system, a SHA-256 accelerator was developed. In addition,
it was decided to design and integrate a DMA module in order to improve the throughput of
the system. The new modules were then added to a CPU tile. Since it is not possible
to parallelize a single run of the SHA-256 algorithm, multiple, independent tiles
in a grid are used to run multiple SHA-256 computations at the same time.

\section{Accelerated Hashing Tile}
\label{sec:aht}

In order to test the effects of accelerating SHA-256 hashing, a new tile containing a hashing
accelerator and a DMA was developed for SHMAC. A high-level overview of the new tile can be
seen in Figure \ref{fig:SHA-Tile}.

\begin{figure}[htb]

    \caption{SHMAC tile with SHA-256 accelerator and DMA. Added components are highlighted in red.}
    \label{fig:SHA-Tile}
\end{figure}

The new tile is derived from the Turbo Amber tile, which contains
a Turbo Amber CPU and peripherals such as an interrupt controller and timer modules, connected
together with a wishbone bus.
The SHA-256 accelerator and the DMA's slave interface and master interface is added to this bus.

The tile also needs an arbiter to arbitrate between the DMA master and the CPU on the wishbone bus.
For this purpose, the reference arbiter from the Wishbone Public Domain Library for VHDL % \cite{WBLibrary}
was adapted for use. This is a round-robin arbiter, with its function illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:WBArbiter}.

%
%For this project, the ARB0001a: 4 Level, Round-robin Arbiter from WISHBONE Public Domain Library for VHDL has been taken in use.
%Figure \cite{fig:WBArbiter} shows how the arbitration works, with Round-robin.
%The arbiter will in turn check each input master for bus requests, and grants access thereby.
%If a master has no request, the arbiter will continue to the next.
%For this project, only two masters are present.
%Arbitration normally take a full clock cycle.
%See \cite{WBLibrary} for detailed implementation.

\end{figure}

Round-robin arbiters work well in data acquisition systems where data is collected and placed into memory, since peripherals must often store data to memory.
The choice of this arbiter is because using an already established wishbone arbiter saves time for this project as opposed to desiging a new one, which may end up less efficient if done poorly.

\subsection{SHA-256 Hashing Module}

The hashing module made for this project is a simple implementation of the algorithm described in
Appendix \ref{app:hashing-algo}. It uses 65 cycles to compute the hash of its input data, running
one iteration of the SHA-256 compression function every cycle except cycle 65, which is used to
form new intermediate hash values from the results of the compression function. The algorithm is
specified in big-endian format in \cite{fips180-4}, including necessary constants, so the module
was designed to do the calculation in big-endian to reduce the possibility of errors. A high-level
overview of the module is available in figure \ref{fig:sha256-module}.

\end{figure}

In order for the module to remain generic, so that it can also be used in cryptography, 
an optimization specifically for bitcoin mining has been omitted; this means that the module
does not support doing the two-pass hashing required by the bitcoin protocol, instead relying
on software to set up correct input data for the second pass. It also relies on software to
do the neccessary padding of the input data as required by the SHA-256 algorithm.

Even for generic SHA-256 hashing, several optimizations are possible. The SHA-256 algorithm
includes 64 32-bit constants, one for each round of the compression function. These can be
stored in a block RAM memory to save some logic resources \cite{optimizing-sha2}. However, this occupies valuable
block ram resources that, in SHMAC, is used both by CPUs and scratchpad memory tiles. Thus,
using block RAMs for optimization would place limits on how many tiles can be included in
a SHMAC design; indeed, it was observed when synthesizing large designs with many cores
that the FPGA would run out of block RAM before any other resources according to the synthesis logs.

Another optimization, that has already been mentioned in Section \ref{sec:fpga-mining}, is
pipelining. This can increase the throughput to as much as one hash per cycle, but will require
a large amount of additional logic because of the amount of data required by each iteration
of the SHA-256 compression function. The state required would include 2048~bits of storage
for the expanded message block in addition to the two sets of 8 32-bit words needed for
state and the intermediate hash value respectively.

The module is controlled by the processor using a memory-mapped interface. This allows the use
of a DMA to offload data transfer between memory and the hashing module. The memory-mapped interface
provides registers for 512 bits of input and 256 bits of output data, in addition to control and
status registers. This interface can also be used for accelerators of other cryptographic hash
functions which processes input data of the same length and returns a hash of 256 bits or less,
such as RIPEMD-160 or RIPEMD-256 \cite{ripemd} or the still popular MD5 algorithm \cite{md5}.
With some work, the interface could be made even more generic in order to support algorithms
with other input and output sizes; a possibility would be to eliminate the input and output
registers completely in favour of using a DMA built into the module to move data of arbitrary
sizes into and out of the module.

Another, alternative interface to the module that was considered was using the co-processor interface
of the CPU to communicate with the module. The ARM instruction set supports up to 16 coprocessors,
which can be communicated with using the \texttt{mrc} and \texttt{mcr} instructions. In such a scheme,
the DMA could either transfer data to and from the accelerator directly with the coprocessor instructions,
or by including a DMA in the hashing accelerator to transfer data to and from the accelerator. This would,
however, preclude the DMA from being used as a general data transfer module, providing unnecessary
overhead in terms of possibly unused logic.

\subsection{DMA Module}

The DMA module was designed for the purpose of investigating whether separate data transfers with DMA could improve throughput and energy efficiency of the hashing process, and also gain energy savings by freeing up the on-tile CPU for other work or sleeping. An overview of the module can be seen in figure \ref{fig:DMATop}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Figures/DMA/DMATopview}
    \caption{DMA overview, including wishbone interfaces.}
    \label{fig:DMATop}
\end{figure}

The DMA module consists of the DMA logic itself, in addition to a wishbone slave interface for configuration
and a wishbone master interface for transferring data.
It transfers words of 32-bit data using single-cycle wishbone transfers. In addition, the DMA supports
swapping the endianness of the data it copies. This improves performance when used with the SHA-256
accelerator, because the results from the accelerator are in big-endian
and must be converted to little-endian to give the correct results when used by the software running on the processor.
Converting endianness in software adds several additional instructions per hash, which are now avoided.
If endian swapping is active, the data bytes are swapped combinatorcially before being passed on to the wishbone master.

The wishbone slave consists of three registers for each DMA channel, used for base source address, base destination address, and details of the transfer.
When request is activated, the selected channel receives data from the slave, and executes the transfer.
An arbiter arbitrates between the channels if both are active.
Every single command, either load or store, are passed from the channels to the wishbone master, where they are executed.
Loaded data is passed on to the corresponding channel, and a channel informs the wishbone master when it is finished, so that the slave interface is informed when the final transfer is done executing.
The corresponding request detail register is modified, and an interrupt request is sent to the interrupt controller.

The current DMA module only supports transfers of single 32-bit words, while the interconnect used between tiles in SHMAC supports 128-bit blocks.
This means four transfers are done on the network for each 128-bit blocks, when only one entire block transfer is needed. 
The reason for not expanding to 128-bit blocks was due to compatibility issues with the SHA-256 module. 
We were concerned that expanding would force blocks to have an alignment of 128-bits, which would make the DMA harder to use from a software perspective and add additional difficulties in transferring data to and from the registers of the hashing accelerator. 
Otherwise they would have had to be changed so that they would be correctly aligned.
%While transferring aligned blocks of data from one memory location to another is common, switching a 32~bit word's position inside a block would not be possible for the DMA, if we were to expand the size without making considerable change to the DMA. 
%We were concerned that this could prevent us from transferring data between neighbour registers on the tile.
%Furthermore, it was concidered outside the scope of the project to further enhance the DMA module, as the main idea was that this would enhance SHMAC generally, but not the hashing module.
%In order to focus remaining project time on the hashing module, and to have the ability to write to any register inside the tile, 32-bit data transfer were chosen.

\section{System architecture}
\label{sec:SHMAC_sys_arch}

The CPU tile with the integrated SHA-256 accelerator and DMA module was placed in a grid with other similar CPU tiles in order
to exploit the thread-level parallelism offered by the SHMAC architecture.
The test designs were synthesized using Xilinx' Vivado software suite, version 2013.4, and
uploaded to the Versatile Express machine.

\subsection{Initial 5x4 Grid Architecture}
Initially, a 20~tile setup was used on SHMAC. The following tiles were included in the design:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 16 CPU tiles with on-tile DMA module and SHA-256 accelerator
    \item 2 scratchpad tiles
    \item 1 DRAM tile
    \item 1 I/O tile
\end{itemize}

The layout is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:5x4}. The I/O tile is placed to the
left of the first processor in the system, as only the first processor tile is used
for communicating with the host system. This gives the first processor a ``dedicated''
connection to the I/O tile, preventing data that is sent to the host from interferring
with data transfers needed for the hashing benchmark application. In addition, the
rectangular grid was chosen to ensure that all cores are placed as close as possible
to the memory tiles to reduce the latency of memory transfers.

    \label{fig:5x4}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Alternative 15x2 Grid Architecture}
As testing uncovered a possible hardware bug in the implementation of the scratchpad tiles,
discussed in Section \ref{sec:init-results}, a second design had to be created
in order to measure the scaling of the performance and energy efficiency when using accelerators.

The second design places all processor tiles in a single row. This causes all traffic
to the memory tiles, placed on the row below, to come from above, which bypasses the
scratchpad bug.
The design contains 14 CPU tiles and is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:15x2}. The
current implementation of SHMAC does not allow more than 15 tiles on each row due
to only using 4 bits to represent each grid coordinate.
