\todo{Note to self(Torbj√∏rn): I'll double check if there is sufficient material provided with this conclusion}
The results presented in this report shows that although SHMAC is not powerful
enough to participate in the bitcoin network, an accelerator provides a huge
performance boost to the calculation of SHA256 hashes and can be used in other
applications.

Bitcoin mining is currently an activity that requires a tremendous amount of computing power.
As such, it is no surprise that ASICs rule this domain.
